			<p class="aboutme-p">My name is Troy Morgan, I am an aspiring web developer and former arborist of fifteen years.  I am currently adding the Georgia Tech Virtual Full-Stack Web Development Boot Camp on a full time basis, which means I am currently spending most of my time practicing my coding skills in the languages I have currently learned, HTML and CSS.  When I finish the boot camp, I hope to find a new career in the web development industry and build my own fishing blog and a web application to enhance the traffic to that site.  When I find a career in the desired field, I think I might be able to resume family life and my main hobby, fishing for bass from my kayaks.
